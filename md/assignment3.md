# Assignment 3: AI, Security, and Cross-Disciplinary Communication 
This assignment will introduce the usage, strengths and weaknesses in Artificial Intelligence, AI, Safety and Security Online and Cross-Disciplinary Communication from my point of view as a student in Intercultural Studies. The assignment will be written based on my personal experience and books that I have encountered before. 

### Artificial Intelligence
The development, usage and exposure to Artificial Intelligence is as rapid as ever while our understanding towards it lacks update or simply we can’t keep up with it. However, it is important to at least understand it from your perspective or your field of studies or activities, which in my case for me would be a student in intercultural studies. In terms of its influence in intercultural studies as a whole, as mentioned in the first assignment, it is inevitable to take in digital technologies, AI in account for such human centric studies as it influences human behavior. Taking this into account, personally as a student, I feel the lack of strength in coming up with ideas and memorizing after the using and being accustomed to AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, probably the most used and accessible AI tools for students. Personally I only use them when I am very stuck with ideas or having a difficult time in organizing my ideas however, I cannot recall how I have done them all without it when I was in highschool for example that I feel retarded more than ever. Moreover, I often use grammarly for grammatical corrections and it shows how many times that I have made the same mistake which indicates how this error is merely surpassing my brain without any reflection or stimulation. A mental psychologist [Anders Hansen](https://sites.prh.com/andershansen) has written in his book that these technologies deprive our functionality in our brain of deeper processes and thinking while being addicted to overstimulation and lacking patience. Therefore recently it has become a trend to “digital detox” to cure your brain and mind for stimulation and get "bored". Immediate response from ChatGPT might be a great solution when efficiency is the key or when I had to use them to provide further explanation on Danish grammar which is not in the textbook. However, it is crucial to take a break and revisit old media such as books and taking notes to exercise your brain and revitalize them.

### Safety and Security Online
Staying safe online and protecting your data is what probably our generation or above is not taught enough as AIs and development of digital technology has bursted recently. Here are the lists of what I have heard or have done to avoid public exposure and extraction of my data even though I know that it is not enough. 
1. Create a long and personal password. 
I try to create a long password with a mix of capital and small alphabets and numbers as well as special letters such as !@#. I sometimes cannot believe how people save their password on the same drive or a google doc while they are super accessible. My method is rather analog, in that I write them down on a note pad and if you use the password frequently, you can easily remember them. Making it personal is also a point for me. I usually use Japanese , Danish, and French mixed words , which are all the languages I have learned before to write a favorite quote from a movie or lyrics. 
2. Delete the passport or any important images afterwards
Due to everything being able to apply online recently such as my student visa for Denmark, I have no choice but to upload my passport pictures in fact an every page copy (for Denmark) in my computer to upload them in a visa center. Therefore, I deleted them immediately, even from my trashbox, after I discovered a con for passport replication done based on the image that was left on the drive. 
3. Keeping my Software Updated
Using an old version for any of your devices can lead to lower protection and thus I update my software as soon as I get a notification. This tip has also been introduced in class however, some people were not aware of it which explains how shallow we know about how our data is processed and exposed. 
However, knowing more the more I get anxious and how I feel small in the digitalized world. It might be impossible to protect everything however, as a normal citizen, it is rare that you get involved in a  cyber terrorism or spy act (for now…) and therefore, it is still worth knowing what you can at least do to prevent from fishing and small scams. 

### Cross-Disciplinary Communication
Finally this section will introduce how collaboration between technical and non-technical disciplines improves digital projects and helps bridge gaps in understanding. The example below might not be directly related to humanities, but more on what I have worked with before my masters which is journalism. As a student, I published some articles about political participation for youth generations in Japan and I had to deal with numbers of questionnaire results as well as improving my language skills. Here is where technical tools came into practice to store the questionnaire data as well as analyzing my writing tendencies to improve my writing. Moreover, I have used technical analytics on social media to see how many people, what kind of gender, which generation etc have accessed the post or an article to improve my next article and share the results. Even though my use of technical tools are confined in the area of analysis and storage, it has enhanced my efficiency in work and how to create more interesting materials online from a numerical perspective. 
I believe that refusing and restricting the use of AI and digital tools are not a solution since to understand is to use as well as being informed and accustomed to it is the first step to defend your data as well as using them for a better cause.
