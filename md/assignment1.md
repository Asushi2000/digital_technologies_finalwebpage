### Introduction
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12px" >Humanities and digital technologies seem to be placed in an opposing field of studies that makes humanities students feel alienated with the utilization of digital technologies or tools to their field of interest. However, in this digitalized world, it is crucial for not only the obvious scientists and engineers but also for humanities researchers to utilize and be accustomed to digital technologies. This assignment will focus on how digital technologies are used and can be used in the field of my interest which is Interculturality in Sustainability Communication including my own experience for my other courses in Aarhus University. The assignment will highlight the enhancement of practicality, efficiency and credibility for humanity studies by installing digital technologies especially in the context of conducting corporate analysis or quantitative analysis. Consequently, the paper will propose how I intend to use digital technologies in my master thesis as well as encouraging humanities studies to include digital technology courses to establish the knowledge around the field as well as enhance efficiency and credibility. </p>

### Current digital technology usage in Sustainability Communication
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12px" >Previous involvement in sustainability projects and research in along and aside education, they explicitly deliver the utilization and significance of digital technology in sustainability communication. One of the scenes where digital technologies came into place is when humanities, sustainable communication research corporate data and projects as a research material. In terms of collaborating humanity research and background with companies, digital technologies are crucial to comprehend the situation and analyze the issue (Lauring et al, 2021). I have experienced this when I entered as an intern in the co-project led by [Mitsubishi](https://www.mitsubishicorp.com/jp/ja/index.html), a Japanese autonomous multinational company and [Vestas](https://www.vestas.com/en/about/this-is-vestas), a Danish sustainable energy company to implement Japan’s first offshore wind farm project in one of the depopulated area called Akita and revitalize there as a sustainable town. The task as an intern was to reflect and revise the communication strategies between Japanese Mitsubishi staff, Danish Vestas staff, and the Japanese local community members. To understand what “sustainability” meant to each of the group members, we reflected and compared both company’s sustainability reports, their previous sustainability projects and interviewed some local members about “sustainability”. Conducting intercultural studies often result in case studies in such case specific phenomenon or issue (Rozbicki, 2015) and therefore, the process of research is not linear but modular and sensitizing (Madsen & Mabokela, 2016). In other words, the understanding of the case and the development of the research deepens as the research proceeds by dealing with multiple empirical data (Rozbicki, 2015).  Therefore, the research ended up with quantitative collection of data, where a deductive research approach was taken for an analysis method (Welch & Piekkari, 2017). The method requires coding (Zoelner, 2025) the key words that appeared in the reports and interviews to formulate a pattern (Zoelner, 2025) to conclude this case dependent research. It is significant to note that the goal of this case study, nor in any case dependent intercultural studies (Olsen & Rasmussen, 2015; Rozbicki, 2015) is to generalize or formulate a pattern, but to analyze and comprehend the specific case or a situation better to solve an issue. However, to deal and manage the keywords and data to reach a conclusion or a pattern to figure the situation, digital technologies were a crucial tool. We used Chat GPT, a different text mining tool, and Excel to effectively pick up words that were frequently used, as well as recording the results. Similar to the above research, when conducting a sustainable annual report analysis for Mærsk in the course for the previous semester required the same tool and methods. Imagining how the same research would have been done decades ago manually, social scientific as well as humanities studies research encounter the need to utilize digital technology to provide efficiency and accuracy. 

Consequently, digital tools provide credibility and transparency to humanities studies. In the academic field, it is severe for humanities and social science academic papers to attain spotlight compared to scientific research where results are directly connected to numbers providing imaginable and tangible logic and credibility (Linneberg, et al. 2021, Welch & Piekkari, 2017). Therefore, Linneberg et al. (2021) suggests to include data analysis and coding methods to the humanities area of studies to assure transparency which requires utilization of digital technologies. According to Linneberg et al. (2021) coding is a method for both qualitative and quantitative research which puts labels on the accumulated data to provide a summative and salient conclusion. Indeed, when conducting a data analysis for comparing sustainability reports from the previous research, the coding method came into practice with the utilization of tools such as Voyant for finding frequently used terms. This came practical and efficient as sustainability reports for the company came in over 100 pages as well as enhancing transparency and credibility when digital tools are utilized in the research instead of manual coding as it separates the researchers’ bias in the research. </p>

### Potential Digital Technologies Usage in the Field of Humanities
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12px" > For my master thesis, I am planning to research the strategic communication used in sustainable startups to enhance publicity and support to the stakeholders. The thesis aims to analyze how sustainable driven startups communicate their values and products to the stakeholders and succeed in business. The paper states this alignment between the sustainability startup and business as intercultural as “sustainability” and “business” are two different cultures reflecting different backgrounds, needs, and goals. This idea of sustainability and business as two different cultures is driven from the theory by Zaman et al. (2025) and a reporter from [2030 Builders](https://2030.builders/6-reasons-why-companies-struggle-to-achieve-sustainability-goals/#:~:text=Another%20significant%20barrier%20to%20achieving,or%20employee%20training%20and%20development.); a company that supports companies to reach sustainable goals effectively, located in Copenhagen, that small to middle scale companies often struggle with reaching an alignment or agreeing with the same sustainability goals when meeting with the stakeholders for financial support or market demands that they will often have to lower the sustainability expectation. Indeed, during my journey with Deep Green Innovators, they stressed that it is important for the founders to stress on the green aspect of the idea but at the same time to pitch on what is in it for the funders and customers which many of the startups participants felt uncomfortable or difficult. 

Moving on to how I intent to use digital technology for such research, first of all, I plan to use tools such as **BeautifulSoup by Python, Scrapy** to collect the startups sustainability reports, press releases, or CSR statements which is time efficient than researching it manually on the server. Secondly, I would like to apply text analysis or sentiment analysis by using **NLTK** to identify differences or similarities to form a pattern in strategic sustainability communication among different startups. Furthermore, if there is a necessity to conduct social media analysis to uncover how the startups use and communicate their sustainability and brand formulation, the research will also include platforms namely, LinkedIn, X, or Instagram. In such research for trends and brand analysis, digital tools such as **Netlytic, or Brandwatch** come in great means as it analyzes audience engagement and communication styles. Overall, it is evident that there are various automotive tools to compare, analyze and map data analysis for intercultural research topics. Especially when it comes to intercultural case analysis which requires massive collection of various numerical and verbal data. The above stated thesis idea is merely an idea at the moment however, usage of digital tools are inevitable for intercultural case analysis consequently indicates that it is crucial for the intercultural researchers to know how to use them as well as its consequences to not only conduct but also protect your research which the below paragraph and the assignment 3 will state in detail. </p> 

### Further Implementation and Adaptation
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12px" > This paper has focused on the usage of digital technologies in the process of data accumulation and data analysis however, it could further be adapted to showcase the findings. As Linneberg, et al. (2021) repeatedly mentions, numerical data can be prioritized in the academic field which also include visualization of the data. However, there is little research in the humanities studies which include visual aids such as graphs and tables to show the process of the coding, even in quantitative research analysis. With the use of digital tools such as Tableau, Power BI and Story Maps, humanities research stories could be visualized easily and interactively to the audience. This could be relevant to especially humanities studies as their research field is highly contextualized (Olsen et al., 2019) often based on projects which they value the specific context, in other words background stories and research process. Therefore, those digital tools could be utilized to showcase their highly contextualized research journey with comprehensible visual aids as well as researchers themselves could reflect on it easily rather than going through each text.

Digital technologies are very efficient in numerical and visual representation of research and analysis however, it should also be balanced on how further they could be used and it also means that it requires training to use digital materials effectively and academically to humanities studies. Even in using Voyant, you would have to know how to delete words that are not relevant to the research. Using Excel sheets, it is useful if you are acquainted with some commands rather than typing every single word manually. Without training in those digital tools, the research outcome could be faulty as well as inefficient. Therefore, it would be highly recommended to learn how to use those tools during academic or education even before Universities as these could also come in hand with other fields of work. Moreover, in the humanities studies and intercultural studies, it is crucial to think about the degree of usage and involvement of digital tools in the research. The above paragraphs have described analytical tools for reports and visual materials online such as the sustainability report and social media; however, there are various intercultural research dealing with field work with human engagement, more non-tangible cultural values. In those types of research, the use of digital tools for analysis could be restricted to use them as merely a data recorder. Meanwhile, anthropological and cultural researchers mention that understanding digital technologies in culture and humans are crucial for their field of research as humans are connected and deeply influenced by the digital world due to its prevalence (Poulopoulos & Wallace, 2022). Therefore, its understanding of digital technology and its relation to the humanities field are significant not only as a research material but as humans, which are the research topic for humanities and cultural research, are embedded with digital technology that it is impossible to exclude the digitalization aspect to the field of research. </p>

### Conclusion
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12px" > This paper has examined the role of digital technologies in the processes of data collection and analysis, highlighting their potential to improve not only methodological efficiency but also the transparency and communication of research outcomes. As Linneberg et al. (2021) observe, academic practice often privileges numerical data and their visualization, yet within the humanities, the use of visual aids such as graphs, matrices, or tables remains relatively underdeveloped. The integration of digital tools could significantly enhance the visibility and interpretability of humanities research by enabling findings to be presented in a more dynamic, interactive manner. It is also crucial to update and raise awareness on the tools that are available as research aids as a number of humanities students are not relevant with those technologies. This is highly recommended as humanities research tends to be deeply contextualized (Olsen et al., 2019), as well as it is necessary when it comes to practical and fieldwork based projects such as the project I conducted with Mitsubishi and Vestas. Finally, the prevalence of digital technology makes it inevitable for humanities and cultural researchers to omit the influence of digitalization on humankind. Therefore, it is recommended that digital literacy and methodological training be incorporated into educational frameworks, preparing scholars from an early stage to engage effectively with digital tools.</p>
