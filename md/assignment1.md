<p style="color: blue; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px" >Before diving into the topic of my studies and digital technologies, here are some background information about me. </p>

| **Field** | **Information** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Name** | Azusa Yamazaki|
| **University** | Aarhus University |
| **Studies** | Master's in Intercultural Studies, English |
| **Degree** | Bachelor's in International Relations and Media |

I am currently enrolled in Intercultural Studies, a masters programme by Aarhus University. The current courses I am enrolled in are…
1. Digital Technologies in the Humanities
2. Sustainability as a Way of Life
3. Intercultural Projects in a Transnational World

Aside from my studies, I am involved in a sustainable startup program run by Deep Green Innovators that are provided by Aarhus, Aalborg, Copenhagen, and Copenhagen Business Universities which gave me insights on my master thesis development. My master thesis is aimed to cover the alignment between sustainability and business communication in a sustainable startup journey. Through this experience in exploring sustainable communication and business alignment, it has come to my  realization that digital technology is deeply connected with intercultural studies in a sustainability manner as well.

### Introduction
Humanities and digital technologies seem to be placed in an opposing field of studies that makes humanities students utilize technologies to their field of interest. However, in this digitalized world, it is crucial for not only the obvious scientists and engineers but also for humanities researchers to utilize and be accustomed to digital technologies. This assignment will focus on how digital technologies are used and can be used in the field of my interest which is Interculturality in Sustainability including my own experience for my other courses in Aarhus University. It will highlight the enhancement of practicality, efficiency and credibility for humanity studies by installing digital technologies especially in the context of conducting corporate analysis or quantitative analysis. Consequently, the paper will propose how I intend to use digital technologies in my master thesis as well as encouraging humanities studies to include digital technologies to enhance efficiency and credibility. 

### Current digital technology usage in Sustainability Communication
I have been on a few sustainability projects and research that explicitly delivers the utilization and significance of digital technology in sustainability communication. One of the scenes where digital technologies came into place is when humanities, sustainable communication has to be integrated with company data and projects. In terms of collaborating humanity research and background with companies, digital technologies are crucial to comprehend the situation and analyze the issue (Lauring et al, 2021). I have experienced this when I entered as an intern in the co-project led by [Mitsubishi](https://www.mitsubishicorp.com/jp/ja/index.html), a Japanese autonomous multinational company and [Vestas](https://www.vestas.com/en/about/this-is-vestas), a Danish sustainable energy company to implement Japan’s first offshore wind farm project in one of the depopulated area called Akita and revitalize there as a sustainable town. The task as an intern was to reflect and revise the communication strategies between Japanese Mitsubishi staff, Danish Vestas staff, and the Japanese local community members. To understand what “sustainability” meant to each of the group members, we reflected and compared both company’s sustainability reports, their previous sustainability projects and interviewed some local members about “sustainability”. Ending up with quantitative data, we took a deductive research approach (Welch & Piekkari, 2017) which required coding (Zoelner, 2025) some of the key words that appeared in the reports and interviews to formulate a pattern (Zoelner, 2025) and conclude the research. We used Chat GPT, text mining tool, and Excel to effectively pick up words that were frequently used, as well as recording the results. This is where I encountered digital technology usage in social scientific, humanities related research and realized how digital technologies provide efficient, and credible information.

Consequently, digital tools provide credibility and transparency to humanities studies. In the academic field, it is severe for humanities and social science academic papers to attain spotline compared to scientific research where results are directly connected to numbers which provide instant logic and thus credibility (Linneberg, et al. 2021, Welch & Piekkari, 2017). Therefore, Linneberg et al. (2021) suggests to include data analysis and coding methods to the humanities area of studies to assure transparency which requires utilization of digital technologies. According to Linneberg et al. (2021) coding is a method for both qualitative and quantitative research which puts labels on the accumulated data to provide a summative and salient conclusion. Indeed, when I conducted data analysis for a sustainability report for my class on interculturality in organizational context, I made sure to utilize Voyant for finding frequently used terms. This came practical and efficient as sustainability reports for the company came in over 100 pages. 

### Potential Digital Technologies Usage in the Field of Humanities
For my master thesis, I am planning to research the use of the term sustainability in Danish and Japanese companies to reflect on the interculturality in the term “sustainability” and how it could avoid cultural frictions in intercultural cooperation. Here I plan to use tools such as **BeautifulSoup by Python, Scrapy** to collect corporate sustainability reports, press releases, or CSR statements from Danish and Japanese firms which is time efficient than researching it manually on the server. Secondly, I would like to apply text analysis or sentiment analysis by using **NLTK** to identify differences in sustainability discourse. Furthermore, if I should be conducting social media analysis to compare how Danish and Japanese companies present sustainability on platforms like LinkedIn, X, or Instagram, I would be able to use tools like **Netlytic, or Brandwatch** which analyzes audience engagement and intercultural communication styles.
It is evident that there are various automotive tools to compare, analyze and map data analysis. Especially when it comes to quantitative comparative analysis. Here are only my drafted methods however, I would further develop a concrete research method plan to conduct my thesis from next semester. 

### Further Implementation and Adaptation
This paper has focused on the usage of digital technologies in the process of data accumulation and data analysis however, it could further be adapted to showcase the findings. As Linneberg, et al. (2021) repeatedly mentions, numerical data can be prioritized in the academic field which also include visualization of the data. However, there is little research in the humanities studies which include visual aids such as graphs and tables to show the process of the coding, even in quantitative research analysis. With the use of digital tools such as Tableau, Power BI and Story Maps, humanities research stories could be visualized easily and interactively to the audience. This could be relevant to especially humanities studies as their research field is highly contextualized (Olsen et al., 2019) often based on projects which they value the specific context, in other words background stories and research process. Therefore, those digital tools could be utilized to showcase their highly contextualized research journey with comprehensible visual aids as well as researchers themselves could reflect on it easily rather than going through each text. 

Digital technologies are very efficient in numerical and visual representation of research and analysis however, it should also be balanced on how further they could be used and it also means that it requires training to use digital materials effectively and academically to humanities studies. Even in using Voyant, you would have to know how to delete words that are not relevant to the research. Using Excel sheets, it is useful if you are acquainted with some commands rather than typing every single word manually. Without training in those digital tools, the research outcome could be faulty as well as inefficient. Therefore, it would be highly recommended to learn how to use those tools during academic or education even before Universities as these could also come in hand with other fields of work. 

### Conclusion
This paper has examined the role of digital technologies in the processes of data collection and analysis, highlighting their potential to improve not only methodological efficiency but also the transparency and communication of research outcomes. As Linneberg et al. (2021) observe, academic practice often privileges numerical data and their visualization, yet within the humanities, the use of visual aids such as graphs, matrices, or tables remains relatively underdeveloped. The integration of digital tools could significantly enhance the visibility and interpretability of humanities research by enabling findings to be presented in a more dynamic, interactive manner. It is also crucial to update and raise awareness on the tools that are available as research aids as a number of humanities students are not relevant with those technologies. This is highly recommended as humanities research tends to be deeply contextualized (Olsen et al., 2019), as well as it is necessary when it comes to practical and fieldwork based projects such as the project I conducted with Mitsubishi and Vestas. Therefore, it is recommended that digital literacy and methodological training be incorporated into educational frameworks, preparing scholars from an early stage to engage effectively with digital tools.
