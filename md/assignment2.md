# Assignment 2: APIs and Github
This assignment will introduce the basics on what is an API and Github, and how they can be used in the academic or a topic of interest. The writings will focus on how the tools can be used in sustainability actions and academics from the perspective of developing sustainability tracking systems, accurate data collection and thus avoiding green washing.

## What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a common language for different softwares and systems to communicate, interact, and request data from one another without having to form their own system or service for a particular purpose. A common example for the usage of API would be for example a weather forecasting app. When creating such an app, instead of processing and collecting the weather data itself, the app will be able to use a weather service’s API to fetch the weathering data [MuleSoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/api/what-is-an-api#:~:text=API%20stands%20for%20Application%20Programming,how%20the%20other%20is%20built.). 

## How can it be used in professional work?
Through my journey at Deep Green Innovators, I was one of the startup members to develop a carbon emission detecting service for construction sites in Denmark. Personally, not being a software engineer, we had to rely on one of the members for the software construction; however, our plan was to use APIs from previous company’s construction data as well as carbon emission detector programs and machines. 
Personally being interested in sustainability, API is a crucial tool to be used correctly as it determines how lower the carbon emission is and leads to the success, thus branding and image of the company or a group. One of the platforms that provides sustainability data API is [AUTODESK](https://aps.autodesk.com/sustainability-data-api) where they aim to provide sustainability measurements API to build sustainability applications to access and integrate quality data and insights as well as compliance standards. 
On the other hand, many large companies where they own their analytical systems such as IBM creates their own Green data tracking device extracting data from API from their own IBM Planning Analytics [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics/partners/iena-green-track).  The green track device is called Iena, which is available for the subscribed customers to use as a service. Iena Green Track is built over IBM Planning Analytics using API and therefore, exclusively used for IBM however, it is an example for how data analysis and forming come into place by APIs and how a software company like IBM utilizes them. 

## What is a Github?
- A Github is a platform on the web for developers to store, manage, and even be able to collaborate on coding [Github](https://github.com/). The **version control** enables the coders to reproduce and revise the changes as every step and suggestions are time tracked and also reversible. Moreover, due to this function, mistakes can be spotted easily as well as being able to go back. 
- It also ensures **transparency** as the repositories can be in public, thus enabling everyone to access and download the service, as well as peer reviews. Those peer reviews can be in a form of discussion, where the revisitors can ask or call for improvement to the author or the original coder. 
- Another interesting function is a **shared authorship**. This function makes it easier for researchers to collaborate, co-write an article or a code. Not only does it allow them to write them together, it allows the authors to ask for changes before being immediately changed. There is a room for discussing and reviewing before changing, which enhances transparency and deeper engagement between the authors. 
- Moreover, there is an explanation in Github that it can be **Globally collaborated** without the need to use VPN. This brings researchers close to collaboration as well as enhancing efficiency in their work. 
- Therefore, Github enhances transparency, thus credibility as well as efficiency in collaboration works. Allowing public reviews enhances and stimulates new perspectives and thus uploads the idea stated originally to the newest version. It also allows the researchers to think creatively by reviewing the comments by being in their office without attending academic conferences. 

## How can it be used in professional work?
The API section mentioned how sustainability tracking data can utilize API, however this paragraph introduces how Github can also be used to collect accurate sustainability data. Revising data is a crucial element for sustainability reputation and report which requires transparency to avoid green washing (Sneideriene & Legenzova, 2024) where Github repositories can come into practice due to its former explained values in transparency and credibility. Below will introduce a Github repo found that deals with sustainable data. 

## Example Repo: SustainSight
### Resource: [Github repo link](https://github.com/nikwilms/ESG-Score-Prediction-from-Sustainability-Reports)
### What is SustainSight?
Sustainsight is a repository contains code and data for a machine learning model that **predicts ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores** based on sustainability reports and company data. It's a valuable resource for researchers, investors, and sustainability professionals interested in ESG score prediction using machine learning techniques.
### The Project Outcome
The final ensemble model predicts ESG scores with an impressive accuracy, deviating by an average range of **only 8.5%** from actual ESG ratings.
### Future Work: Enhancing Transparency
They aim to incorporate features that make ESG performance transparent and actionable, providing not just scores but also insights into areas for improvement or validation.
### Possible Suggestions
1. Adapt it for other languages
2. Include forecasting
    1. For furhter annual reports
3. Include whether the result meets the regulations
    1. EU, UN, other regional/company guidelines
    2. Legal Guidlines
    3. Other Municipality Changes
