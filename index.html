            <p>Hej, my name is Azusa Yamazaki and I am currently in my Masters in Intercultural Studies at <a href="https://masters.au.dk/">Aarhus University</a>. My bachelors was in International Relations in Journalism. Therefore, I have preiously devoted myself in internships and jobs around embassy and pulishing small articles. 
               one of my memorable work from those days is when I wrote an interview article with the Samoan Embassy in Japan about cultural exchange between Japan and Samoa</p>

            <p>I am from Japan and I have spent my days before my bachelors in Japan. However, I have also studies abroad in New Zealand for a year when I was in the first grade of high school which I am very glad for since it really helped with my English skills with native English users. The second study abroad was when I was in my thrid year of
                bachelors to Denmark for a year which leads to my current path and the reason why I am studying here right now.

I have personally experienced this from when I was in a program called deep green innovators which I participated in one 
                of the startups as a communication advisor. I am looking forward to
